The main idea is to test if there is a deviation in the patterns of
intraindividual expression between putatively selected (balancing) genes
and a control set.

The balsel loci will be surveyed for type of function displayed and also
if the two alleles are "functional", since selection can favor loss of
function variants, and in this case the balsel scenario makes a
different prediction (advantage of monoallelic expression). This would
in fact be a nice control.
