The main idea is to test if there is a deviation in the patterns of
intraindividual expression between putatively selected (balancing) genes
and a control set.

The balsel loci will be surveyed for type of function displayed and also
if the two alleles are "functional", since selection can favor loss of
function variants, and in this case the balsel scenario makes a
different prediction (advantage of monoallelic expression). This would
in fact be a nice control.

Specific analysis.

FOr balsel genes quantify degree of ASE
Compare to genomewide ASE, with controls for:
- GO category
- paralogues (if available)

For HLA it is likely to be really difficult to map the transcripts, due
to the very high level of polymorphism. The way around this would be to
use, rather than the reference genome, an in house assembly process,
where the IMGT alleles provide the reference set.
